### 문제 설명

<p>Fidel invented a circular ring. Its boundary is made of a reflective material and at one point on the circle’s boundary, a laser is placed. He wishes to set the angle of the laser in such a way that it bounces N times around the circle then returns to its original position. How many ways can he choose the initial direction of the laser?</p>

<p>Assume that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection (see the image below; the location of the laser in the image is for demonstration purposes only).</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.</p>

<p>A test case consists of a single integer, N, on a line by itself.</p>

<p>Constraints</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 ≤ T ≤ 3000</li>
	<li>1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>9</sup></li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing the number of ways to launch the laser so that it bounces exactly N times and returns at the exact same point.</p>
